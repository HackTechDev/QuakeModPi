IDGlobe.qc 1.2
Stan Smith   (mailto:StoshSmith@worldnet.att.net)

	This Quake-C mod adds an IFF-style feature.  Usable in both
single-player and net games, when toggled on, it will ID both monsters
and other players.

In Netgames, an ID of another player looks like this:
FRIEND: BOOGYMAN- GRENADE LAUNCHER                   or,
FOE: HOSER- SHOTGUN

An ID of a monster looks like this:
ID: OGRE (CHAINSAW/GRENADE)

	You can also remove the comments from the source and recompile
it to act as a flashlight which will anger monsters it's aimed at.

						-O-

	Also included in this archive is Globe.qc- my flashlight-style
routine, and a progs.dat and config.cfg which enable both.

	To use the progs.dat, just put it and the config.cfg in a
directory inside \quake (I'd recommend \mygame) and run Quake like
this:
		QUAKE -game mygame

	This archive also contains my Flare and Light Globe routines,
both of which have been compiled into the progs.dat.  Flare is on 'f',
IDGlobe on 'i', and Light Globe is on the 'l' key.  This version (1.2)
contains minor bug fixes (incorrectly ID'ed monsters) only...

	Please write back with any questions, comments, or suggestions!
