Q) [Quake lover]: Can we have our own player textures in Quake?
A) [ID Software]: NO! That is NOT possible.
A) [ME :)      ]: YES! That IS possible.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was, just like everybody else, hoping that players could have their own skin
textures when Quake came out. But it wasn't possible. Then the QuakeC compiler
and QuakeC code were released, and I thought, man, it HAS to be possible now! 
So I started trying: 

** Playing with the SetModel(self, "progs/player.mdl"). 
   Problems: - it didn't work
	     - you would *require* multiple models, waisting a lot of bytes and
	     - Quake will crash if you don't have them.

** Exploiting the fact that a model can change in eyes
   Problems: - it didn't work
	     - again, would *require* all models, waisting a lot of bytes and
             - Quake will crash if you don't have them.

** Using the idea that models can have different skins
   Pros: - it WORKED!
         - you only need one player.mdl that has all textures in it
	 - if you don't have the 'new' player.mdl no problem, you will see
           the normal textures instead!
	 - As I improve the code (add teamplay, corpses with correct skins)
           only the SERVERS need to update. All the clients (players) need
           is the new player.mdl, which works just like the normal player.mdl,
           but if you connect to a MultiSkin Server suddenly the models will
           have all sorts of skins!
   Bugs: - The skin will only apply to the body your soul is in. As soon as
	   your soul transfers to a new body (respawns) the corpse skin will
           change to the normal texture. But I will fix this and this is not
           crucial, vital or important at all. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Great! What do I need?


*** If you are a PLAYER, ie someone that will connect to a server:

You need the PLAYER.MDL file. You can replace the old one with this one, or
you can put it in a directory like this:
   / [YOUR QUAKE DIR] / MULTISKIN / PROGS / PLAYER.MDL
Then you start Quake with the "-game multiskin" paramater (or for internet
Quake: "q95 -game multiskin". Quake will then use this model instead. If you
replace the old PLAYER.MDL then you don't need to start with extra parameters,
and you will never notice it is a different PLAYER.MDL until you connect to
a MultiSkin Server and see everybody in his own skin. Of course you can always
mail me with questions


*** If you are a DEDICATED server:

You need the PROGS.DAT file. You place it in it's own dir, example:
   / [YOUR QUAKE DIR] / MULTISKIN / PROGS.DAT
and you add "-game multiskin" to your startup commandline string. All clients
that connect will than be able to change their skins, and clients that have
the new PLAYER.MDL will see those changes, otherwise they'll see the normal
textures. 
THE CLIENTS DO NOT *REQUIRE* NEW FILES! EVERYBODY WILL BE ABLE TO CONNECT, AND
THE CLIENTS WITH THE NEW PLAYER.MDL WILL SEE NEW SKINS, THE OTHER CLIENTS
WILL JUST SEE WHAT THEY ALWAYS SEE. BY USING THIS NEW PROGS.DAT FILE YOU ARE
NOT SACRIFICING ANYTHING, EVERYBODY CAN CONNECT. CLIENTS DO NOT *REQUIRE*
NEW FILES, IT IS OPTIONAL


** If you are a LISTEN server:

You need both packages, you can either replace the old PROGS.DAT and PLAYER.MDL
or you can create the following dirs:
  / [YOUR QUAKE DIR] / MULTISKIN / PROGS.DAT
  / [YOUR QUAKE DIR] / MULTISKIN / PROGS / PLAYER.MDL
If you have:
 - only the progs.dat, MultiSkin will work but you will not see the new 
   textures because you don't have them. Players who DO have the new
   PLAYER.MDL *WILL* see the new textures
 - only the new PLAYER.MDL. Then you don't have the MultiSkin code, and the
   game will be an ordinary game where only the first (normal) skin of the
   player is used.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, I'm using the new PLAYER.MDL and I have connected to a MultiSkin server,
now how do I change skins?

Simple, you bind "IMPULSE 200" to a key, for example q 
(type 'bind q "impulse 200" ' in the console) and whenever you press q (impulse
200) your skin will go up one and you will see a message saying which skin
you now have. There are 19 skins, so after skin 15 pressing q again will 
use skin 0. Whenever you respawn you will see a message reminding you which
skin you have. So if you start and press q, you will see 
   "SKIN: Duke Nukem 3d (1)". This means you have now skin (1), which is Duke
Nukem's skin. if you press q again you will see
   "SKIN: Toad (2)". This means you now have the skin of a cool looking toad.
After skin #18 you will get skin #0, which is the normal Quake skin. The
skin will travel with you, if you respawn you will keep the same skin and you
will get a message telling you what skin you 'are wearing'.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm curious, which skins are there?

0) The normal Quake texture. 
   When you first connect to a normal Quake MultiSkin Server you will start 
   with this skin. 

1) Duke Nukem 3d. 
   Heh heh, now you can have some REAL Duke vs Quake wars :)
   BE SURE TO USE COLOR 6 TO KEEP HIS HAIR YELLOW!

2) Toad.
   A pretty cool looking green creature.

3) Stormtrooper.
   An awesome white-camo enforcer type of guy

4) Max.
   Reminds me of Spiderman, although Max is blue/yellow. Looks like a 
   comicbook-hero. Looks pretty cool.

5) the Terminator.
   A very good version of a half-dead terminator, looks very real.

6) Judge Dredd.
   The one and only...

7) Camo.
   A camouflaged soldier. The prefect skin to camp in dark places.

8) Captain Picard.
   For the Trekkies, and until Startrek Quake comes out.

9) the Wizzard.
   This is the skin of the scrag on a player model. Looks pretty scary.

10) the Predator.
    Awesome skin of the Predator. Not for cissies :)

11) Skeleton.
    With this skin you change into a skeleton with a gun :) Pretty cool skin!

12) Wan-Fu.
    I don't know who this guy is, but he looks like a topless karate-kid :)

13) Henry Rollins.
    Don't know him either. But he would make a good target :)

14) He-Man.
    The one and only Master of the Universe.

15) Boba.
    Who? Oh Boba. Never heard of him :) 

16) Superman.
    That's right, now YOU can be Superman!

17) NYPD.
    If you always wanted to be a cop, this is your chance :)

18) Eh... nameless :)                         
    A nice looking guy with the women's sign on his suit ( O )
                                                         ( + )
Some things:

* I don't expect you to memorize this list, so whenever you select a skin Quake
  will tell you which one you have
* Of course I didn't make all those skins. I got them from the Quake grinder:
  http://www.zipnet.net/~biff/qgrinder/
  Here you will find more stuff and the credits for the skins. I did not ask
  permission to all skin authors, but I assume that since they released the
  skin they expect it to be used and don't mind. 
* Most of these skins do not yet have the axe and fire drawn on them. This
  means that the axe will be completeley black. I asked Biff (Quake Grinder)
  about this and he said he could quickly 'overlap' these portions of the
  normal player texture onto the other textures. So that'll be fixed soon.
* I was able to create this PLAYER.MDL because of the excellent QuakeME 2.3,
  which the author Rene Post made only because I asked him. He's a great guy,
  and his program is the best .MDL viewer/textures editor out there. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have some new textures

Please send them to me, so I can add them to both the code AND the model, so
there will be some kind of standard instead of different PLAYER.MDL's that make
someone who looks like Duke look like He-Man and things like that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks to:

*** Rene Post (author of QuakeME)
    He's really amazing! I ask him one night if could add something to QuakeME
    2.2, and the next day I get QuakeME 2.3 which works *EXCELLENT*. Exactly
    what I had hoped for. I recommend this program!

*** Biff (don't remember last name), maintainer of the Quake Grinder:
    http://www.zipnet.net/~biff/qgrinder/
    For storing the textures and for the fact that he will add the axe and
    fire to the textures

*** Crisco at Stomped.com
    for originally storing the textures (before they went to the Quake Grinder)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other possibilities with this technique:

You could make new skins for the monsters, such as 
- one for health > 80%         (the normal texture)
- one for 50% < health < 80%   (some extra blood)
- one for health < 50%         (lots of blood and gore :)
And then set the skins according to their health.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Misc:

* Your skin will change the instant you impulse 200. 
* Teamplay is still color oriented. A Duke can still kill a Duke.
* Whenever a player respawns, the skin of his former corpse will change back
  into the standard skin.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FUTURE FIXES:

* Add teamplay for skin instead of colors
* Add the option to only allow skin changes when the player is dead to avoid
  some teamp server problems (quickly changing skin)
* Have corpses kep the right skins
* Update the textures with the axe/fire drawn onto them
* Add more textures

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OTHER THINGS I'D LIKE TO SAY :)

People have been complaining about a lot of things, and they are getting fixed
all the time! Some examples:

* Weapons suck!
  We now have heetseekers, proximity grenades, drunk missiles, gib throwers,
  lasers and more coming up!

* Grenades etc should go through teleporters!
  Done. It wasn't a Quake limition, it just required a little editing and
  someone has already done it. Let's fire a stream of nails through a 
  teleporter!

* Monster/player corpses should be solid
  Not only can they be solid, but also gibbable!

* Bulletholes?
  I've been working on this one. Right now I can use the bubble sprite as a
  bullet hole, but when I fire the supershotgun 8 times I get a Packet 
  Overflow beacuse of the 300 bubbles on the wall. I'll figure something out.
  The idea is pretty simple, just spawn a sprite when a bullet hits a wall.

* Monster helper/spawners
  Done/Working on those

* Different skins for each player
  Done! :)

* Interconnected Quake servers.
  Done. Only problem, if the server rejects you you end up in the console.
  But John Carmack has said to be working on a real dedicated big stand-alone
  server, so it's just a matter of time.

* Splashing water
  Whenever the sound of splashing water is played, create a blue particle
  fog on that loation going up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HISTORY:

1.1 - added impulse 201 to descend the list
    - added 3 more skins (Superman, NYPD and some other guy :)
    - replaced the Duke skin with a darker one that also had the axe/fire
    - and of course add the new skins to the code

1.0 - initial release containing 16 skin textures

If you have ANYTHING to ask, just mail me! Also, tell me what features you 
would like added to MultiSkin!
