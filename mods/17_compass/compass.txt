Description of the Modification
-------------------------------
This mod will display the direction you are facing whenever you
hits the TAB key. (don't worry, TAB still shows scores).

How to use Modification
-------------------------------
Just hit TAB.

How to Install the Modification
-------------------------------

Put progs.dat in a directory called compass under your Quake dir.
Put compass.cfg in the same place.
Start Quake using the "-game compass +exec compass.cfg" options.

Technical Details
-----------------
This is a simple little patch that gives the player a compass.
Unfortunatly, this compass is pretty primitive and will only show
the 8 major directions (North, Northwest, West etc...).

It determines the direction by looking at the self.v_angle 
variable. Not knowing any better, I assumed 0 means North so that 
is what I use.

Bugs:
	1. None that I know. Please report any to
	   al@merc-int.com

Future Enhancements:

	1. I would really like to have a graphical compass 
           displayed but I have no idea on how to implement this.
           I thought of replacing the players face display with
           a compass but I don't think this can be done from 
           QuakeC. Another aproach might be to display a compass
           MDL in front of the players face but I have neither the
           knowhow, nor the time to explore this possibility. You
	   are welcome to give it a try yourself.
