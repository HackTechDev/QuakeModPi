Type of Mod
-----------
Quake C  : yes
Sound    : not yet, hope to add a cool sonar ping (anyone got it in .wav?)
MDL      : no

Source Included :  Always


Description of the Modification
-------------------------------

The idea is simple.  Using impulse 13, the radar will search for enemies that
you can't see.  That includes invisible players, enemies behind walls, or out
of your line of sight.  Uses 5 cells per use.

How to Install the Modification
-------------------------------

Compile the included source with all the default qcc files.
Move the .dat file to a subdirectory of quake called radar
or something.  Run quake with the parameter -game radar.  Remember to bind
a key like r to impulse 13.

Technical Details
-----------------

All the new code is in radar.qc, there are only slight modifications to
weapons.qc and defs.qc.  They are marked with comments telling where the
modifications are.
Changes:
Fixed finding worldspawn bug...
Adding next version:
Pingtime and pingowner to prevent multiple finding of same thing...

I'm working on a freeze ray, a wave beam, torpedos, harpoons, and a mod
for the nailgun to add many features (including ricochet and the ability
to pick up spent nails).  My hologram mod is coming along nicely.  Look for
it soon.
