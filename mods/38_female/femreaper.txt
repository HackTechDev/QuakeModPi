fem_reaper-mdl.zip created by: Damian Scott - aka [AO] HarsH - 
TeamFortress Software <scab@teamfortress.com> is a modification of the 
player.mdl that turns the standard Quake player into a woman.  Damian 
has modified the basic player.mdl to be a little more feminine (i.e hips
+ breast) which, when used in conjunction with many female skins, looks 
extremely good.  Damian also compiled a complete list of new female 
sounds that really add to the effect of a female persona.

The modification works simply by adding the .mdl and the .wavs into the
required directory - it works with normal Quake and Reaperbots, and most
other patches that don't mind the player.mdl being modified.

To run the mod in "normal" Quake, simply extract female.mdl into your
Quake directory, then run a -game [female.mdl] or whatever you want to
call it.  To get it to run with reaperbots, simply add the reaperbot
progs.dat into the main directory (i.e Quake\female.mdl\), or simply
replace the existing player.mdl and add the player sounds (using the
existing directory structure).  

Enclosed in the .mdl is a female skin created by Kenneth Scott of 
SkinForge (mfarr@iccnet.ab.ca)  This skin can have top and bottom color 
changed in Quake, and looks quite nice with the fem_reaper.mdl

fem_reaper-mdl.zip is meant to be used with id Software's Quake and Quakeworld.  
The player.mdl and sounds were created by: Damian Scott - aka [AO] HarsH -
